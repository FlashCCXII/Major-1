# Brief Summary of the project's function.
The project is a C coded program that implements a set operations supported by a menu that will prompt for a specific operation, that each of us individually worked on. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa


# MENU
The menu runs on the major1.c code.
The menu displays the 4 operation choices, and an EXIT
Upon choosing an operation to run, the chosen operation will then be displayed, in which the user will have to follow the prompts, which are tailored to the function of the operation.
After following the prompts, the user will then receive an output, thus ending the operation and bringing them back to the menu.
This process continues until the user chooses to exit the menu.

# Power of 2 Operation
This operation runs on the power.c code. 
The code contains a single function that accepts a single positive integer under 2 billion to determine if the integer is a power of 2. 
If the integer is a power of 2, then the output will confirm that the integer is a power of 2. If the integer is not a power of 2, the output will display the next greatest integer that IS a power of 2.
The Power of 2 Operation is done using bitwise operators

# Reverse Bits Operation
This operation runs on the reverse.c code. 
The code contains a single function that accepts a single positive integer under 2 billion in order to reverse all 32 bits and display the decimal value of the new integer.
The operation to reverse the bits is done using bitwise operators.
The Reverse Bits Operation is done using bitwise operators

# Replace Bit Position From Mask Operation
This operation runs on the replace.c code.
The code contains a single function that accepts a single positive integer less than 2 billion, a positive integer mask less than 3 billion, and a bit replacement value between 0 and 31.
This is done in order read an integer, read a mask, read the bit replacement value, and output a new integer at the determined bit location.
The Replace Bit Position From Mask Operation is done using bitwise operators.
# Palindrome Operation
This operation runs on the palindrome.c code.
The code contains a single function that accepts a single positive integer less than 2 billion in order to print out the binary representation of the integer and determine whether or not the integer is a palindrome.
The Palindrome Operation is done using bitwise operators.
